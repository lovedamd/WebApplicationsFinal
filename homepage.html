  <div class="container">

    <h5>Navigation Bar</h5>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">

        <p>
          The navigation bar is a tool you'll find on every page to help you navigate the stock website. 
          You can travel from page to page by clicking the page names up at the top, though note that you 
          can't access the Stock History page unless you are logged in. At the end of the navigation bar 
          is a link that changes depending on your login status. If you aren't logged in it'll say Sign Up / Login 
          but if you are logged in already it is able to detect that you are and it'll say Sign Out like shown 
          here.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h5>Login Page</h5>
    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>
          The login page is a page that lets already registered users log in. There are fields to enter your 
          username and password, as well as a button to submit. After a successful log in it will notify the user 
          and bring them to the homepage here. If the user doesn't have an account already, they can click 
          the link to sign up, and be taken to the sign up page. 
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          The sign up page is a page that allows someone to create a new user. 
          There are required fields, such as name, username, password, and a confirm 
          password field. The register button will take the user to the login page upon 
          a successful sign up. The link at the bottom takes you to the login page in 
          case a user already has an account.

          The picture shows how the stock lookup page looks when you first view it. It has several

          To the right is an example of the graph that is displayed on the stocks page.
          The different colors are used to differentiate between the data being shown. Red is for

          yellow is for the last open price of the stock, and teal is for the last closing price
          of the stock. To get a more detailed number, you can hover over the point on the graph
          you want to know about, and it will be made visible.
